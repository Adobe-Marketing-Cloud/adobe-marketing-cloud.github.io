The SEO Toolbox provides a UI widget that guides authors to optimize their pages for search engines. Since the list of potential criteria for SEO can be arbitrarily long, the SEO Toolbox is built with pluggability in mind. Each plugin, called an "SEO Tool" can contribute a number of criteria that an author needs to check and it can provide a UI to help fix any problems that were detected.
