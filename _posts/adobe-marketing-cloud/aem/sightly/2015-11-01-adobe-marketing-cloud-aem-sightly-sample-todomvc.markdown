This example shows how to build components in [AEM 6](http://www.adobe.com/go/aem) with Sightly. It's a feature-complete implementation of the famous [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) exercise, which is traditionally meant for client-side JavaScript frameworks. This implementation though shows how such an application can easily be built in AEM and it's status persisted on the server using the Apache Sling REST framework.   
All in about 300 lines of server- and client-side JavaScript code, following the latest AEM best practice!
