[Sightly](http://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html "Sightly") is the new HTML templating system introduced with Adobe Experience Manager 6.0. The AEM Brackets Extension provides a smoother development workflow for writing AEM components, offering several features like:   
* Sightly syntax-highlighting;   
* code-completion for Sightly expressions, `data-sly-*` block elements and Use-API Java objects;   
* bidirectional synchronisation.
