This example demonstrates how a Cordova WebView can be added to an existing Android application that uses fragments. Once the Cordova WebView has been added and configured it will then be possible to supply any web content to this view for displaying within your Android app. Furthermore, it is also possible to include Cordova plugins with your Android app that the web content can take advantage of in order to access device features.
