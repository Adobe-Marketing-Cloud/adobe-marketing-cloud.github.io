Development tool to keep your local file system and AEM always in sync: changes made at the local file system will automatically flow to the corresponding AEM instance and vice-versa!

Out-of-the-box integration with the [FileVault Tool (VLT)](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/dev-tools/ht-vlttool.html?wcmmode=disabled) and the [Content Package Maven Plugin](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/dev-tools/vlt-mavenplugin.html?wcmmode=disabled).

For further information, please refer to [AEM VLT Sync website](https://daniel-lima.github.io/aem-vltsync/).
