* mapping generator - enter domain and the content path and Carty will take of everything else,
* mapping editor - edit, move, create and delete sling:Mapping entries,
* tester - check what will be the result of the map or resolve operation,
* highlighter - Carty explains which entries have been applied to a specific part of the tested URL,
* configuration - you may choose any path to create mappings, it doesn't have to be the mapping root currently set in the Resource Resolver
