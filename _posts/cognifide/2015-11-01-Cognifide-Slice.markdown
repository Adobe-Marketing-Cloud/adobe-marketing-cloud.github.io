Slice is a framework which simplifies Sling/Adobe AEM development by using dependency injection pattern (DI). It glues Sling and Google Guice together, allowing developers to create a code with a clean separation of concerns. You can map resources to Java models seamlessly and thanks to DI arrange your application in easily testable and maintainable code.
