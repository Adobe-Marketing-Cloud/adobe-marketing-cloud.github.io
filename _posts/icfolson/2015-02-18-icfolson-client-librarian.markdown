The Client-Librarian is a dependency management mechanism for client side libraries (css, js, less) which builds on the
concepts introduced by the AEM Client Library mechanisms.

* Declare Component and Template dependencies on Client Libraries
* Declare dependencies between Client Libraries
* Produce .css and .js files which are relevant to the components on a page
* Use global [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) variables and mixins in your LESS workflow without external compilation
* Produce multiple brands of .css and .js without unnecessary code duplication
* Provide programmatically generated or environment specific content for .css and .js
