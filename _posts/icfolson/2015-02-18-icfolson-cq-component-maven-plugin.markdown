The CQ Component Plugin generates many of the artifacts necessary for the creation of a CQ Component based on the information provided
by the Component's backing Java Class.

For more information on the Plugin and its usage, please see the [CQ Component Plugin site](http://code.citytechinc.com/cq-component-maven-plugin/)
